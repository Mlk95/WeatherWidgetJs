How could you request data inside the browser, from another domain?
-

What does CORS stand for?
- CORS = Cross-origin-resource sharing.
- 

Please name 5 different HTTP methods and explain what they are used for?
-

What is the difference between 'DOMContentLoaded' and 'Load' events?
- DOMContentLoaded: Event fires when the current page/document has been completly loaded and parsed (DOM-Tree fully constructed).
- Load: Event fires when all resources including images, stylesheets, frames and scripts have been loaded.

What is the DOM?
- The Document Object Model is a interface for the structuring of html and xml documents. Every document in every browser tab you have open is represented by the DOM in a DOM-   Tree. Within the DOM-Tree every element is represented by a node. The DOM allows an easy manipulation through JavaScript which is essential for creating dynamic Websites (for example appending nodes with child nodes which i also did in my task).
